# EL-Firebase-Project

Just another basic website.

This project was for my College's Analog Circuits(Electronics) Course. It took realtime data from the vehicles and sent it to  Firebase Database and dynamically linked all the information about the vehicles on the map using Rasberry Pi and Geological Tracking System.
